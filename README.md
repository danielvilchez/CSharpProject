# Overview

The purpose of this project is to develop a console-based **Employee Management System** using C#. This software demonstrates fundamental concepts of the C# language, including object-oriented programming, inheritance, abstract classes, structures, functions, loops, conditionals, and file handling.

The system allows users to:

- Add employees and managers with personal and professional details.
- Display a list of all employees, including specific information for managers (team size).
- Save employee data to a text file and load it automatically when the program starts.

The purpose of creating this software was to strengthen my understanding of **C# object-oriented programming**, practice working with files, and apply programming concepts in a practical, interactive console application.

# Development Environment

- **IDE/Editor:** Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition (64-bit)
- **Programming Language:** C# 11
- **Framework:** .NET Framework 4.7.2
- **Libraries:** Only standard .NET libraries (System, System.Collections.Generic, System.IO, etc.)


The software was developed entirely in C# using a console application template, with classes and structures organized into separate files for clarity and maintainability.

# Future Work

- Implement editing and deleting employees from the list.
- Add validation for user input to prevent crashes from invalid data.
- Extend the program to include search functionality for employees by name or position.
- Optionally, create a GUI version using Windows Forms or WPF.
- Add encryption to the saved file for better data security.
